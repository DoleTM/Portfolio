Professional Portfolio

My portfolio is currently 3 distinct pages
- About Me
- Deployed Projects
- Contact

I decided to use a nature themed nav bar/footer because each page is different in its own and the three (Jungle, Desert and Ocean) resonate with me the most in a figurative way.

Any and all feedback is appreciated, you can get a hold of me through my contact page if you would like to leave a comment or give some insight.

I am currently working on getting some of the text to read better and overall be more mobile responsive.
