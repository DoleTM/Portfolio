                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    From the beginning of my professional career, I instantly recognized that I had a passion for
                    continual
                    learning. I soon began to take the initiative and became fascinated with improving efficiency in
                    projects bigger
                    than myself. It was here where I honed in on my troubleshooting skills and the ability to work under
                    pressure.
                    After years of hard work I was given an opportunity from a startup company to construct a foundation
                    for a department where I showcased my organizational skills and was able to learn about cost
                    management.
                    Now I have taken the leap into coding to pursue my internal passion for continual learning and the
                    chance to
                    make something through code that would improve efficiency in people's lives.
                </p>

                <h2>Interests</h2>
                <p>
                    After a 10 year hiatus I have picked up a skateboard once again and started regaining muscle memory
                    allowing me to push myself forward to learn more difficult tricks and staying active during the pandemic. 
                    I use skateboarding as a mental outlet that has helped lower stress and anxiety.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Music has always been a passion of mine since I first picked up a trumpet when I was 7 years old. I
                    now play 4 insturments that include the trumpet, saxophone, guitar and keyboard. I enjoy listening to
                    and playing genres such as indie, rock, classic rock, jazz and salsa. I have taken a recent liking to
                    house music that is easy to listen and vibe to. I am always open to listening to new music to expand
                    my musical horizon.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dogs have always been a part of my life from a young age, learning how to take care of different breeds
                    and incorporating the responsibility into my life. I currently have a 9 year old Shiba Inu/Pitbull Mix
                    that loves long walks, cozy naps and chasing squirrels. I have become the go to person in my group of 
                    riends to dogsit while they are away. I take pride in knowing that all my friends trust me with their 
                    pups and have even mentioned that their dogs are having a better 'staycation' with me than they are 
                    on a planned vacation.
