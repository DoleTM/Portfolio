                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    From the beginning of my professional career, I instantly recognized that I had a passion for
                    continual
                    learning. I soon began to take the initiative and became fascinated with improving efficiency in
                    projects bigger
                    than myself. It was here where I honed in on my troubleshooting skills and the ability to work under
                    pressure.
                    After years of hard work I was given an opportunity from a startup company to construct a foundation
                    for a department where I showcased my organizational skills and was able to learn about cost
                    management.
                    Now I have taken the leap into coding to pursue my internal passion for continual learning and the
                    chance to
                    make something through code that would improve efficiency in people's lives.
                </p>

                <h2>Interests</h2>
                <p>
                    I am currently in a pool league where I am able to hone in on my strategy and decision making. I
                    have been playing
                    billards for about 6 years now and enjoy every chance I get to play competitively or for fun with
                    friends.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Music has always been a passion of mine since I first picked up a trumpet when I was 7 years old. I
                    now play 4 insturments
                    that include the trumpet, saxophone, guitar and keyboard. Recently I have taken an interest in
                    learning how to DJ and have
                    tried to play a vibe that I call "The music you didn't know that you wanted to hear"
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have become the go to person in my group of friends to dogsit while they are away. It started
                    with my initial love for dogs and being there when my friends need me because they have done the same
                    in the past. I take pride in knowing that all my friends trust me with their pups and have even mentioned
                    that their dogs are having a better 'staycation' with me than they are on a planned vacation.
