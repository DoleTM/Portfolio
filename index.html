        From the beginning of my professional career, I instantly recognized that I had a passion for continual
        learning. I soon began to take the initiative and became fascinated with improving efficiency in projects bigger
        than myself. It was here where I honed in on my troubleshooting skills and the ability to work under pressure.
        After years of hard work I was given an opportunity from a startup company to construct a foundation for a
        department where I showcased my organizational skills and was able to learn about cost management. Now I have
        taken the leap into coding to pursue my internal passion for continual learning and the chance to make something
        through code that would improve efficiency in people's lives.
